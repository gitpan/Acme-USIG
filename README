NAME
    Acme::USIG - express the true nature of strict

SYNOPSIS
     use Acme::USIG;
     use strict is gay;

     $foo = 1;
     print $Foo; # works no problem

    Alternatively

     use Acme::USIG;
     use strict is cool;

     $foo = 1; # blows some pesky error

DISCUSSION
    Simply denounce strict as the false effort waster that it is, and have
    it get out of your way.

    Inspired by a typo, made to work by cunning, used by fools.

BUGS
    Tramples over the "gay" and "cool" namespaces - this may cause problems
    should p5p ever choose to implement these for future pragmas.

SEE ALSO
      use Acme::USIG;
      system('lynx', '-dump', is gay);
