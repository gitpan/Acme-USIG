What changed over the last 3 revisions

=over

=item 1.04	Saturday 3d October, 2003

	inspired by Matt LeBlanc we now hold onto the previous &strict::import
	and put it back during cool::is to allow lexical declarations of faith


=item 1.03	Saturday 3rd October, 2003

	maintenance release for 5.8.1.
	5.8.1's strict.pm is stricter about what strictures it will honour
	so now gay::is nobbles that too
